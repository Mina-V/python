# 🧹 Text Preprocessing on Social Media Data (Tweets)

This is a beginner-friendly NLP project focused on cleaning and preprocessing tweets using Python and NLTK. It marks one of my first hands-on experiences with real-world text data, where I explored how natural language is structured—and how we can shape it for further analysis.

## 📌 Project Overview

Social media data is often messy, informal, and full of noise. In this project, I used a sample set of tweets and applied a series of preprocessing steps to prepare the data for downstream tasks like sentiment analysis or topic modeling.

The pipeline includes:
- Removing URLs, punctuation, and special characters
- Tokenization
- Stopword removal
- Lemmatization
- Final cleaned text output

Although I leveraged GPT and coding copilots for support, I wrote, ran, and verified the code myself — to ensure I *understand* each step. This is part of my journey into AI development.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NLTK
- Pandas
- re (Regular Expressions)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mina-V/python.git
```

2. Open the notebook:
```bash
cd python
jupyter notebook
```

3. Run `Text Preprocessing on Social Media Data (Tweets).ipynb`

Note: You may need to install NLTK and download necessary packages (`punkt`, `wordnet`, `stopwords`) before running.

## 🔍 Example

**Before Cleaning**:
```
"I can't believe this is happening 😭 #shocked @someone http://t.co"
```

**After Cleaning**:
```
"believe happening shocked"
```

## 📈 Future Work
- Add visualizations (word clouds, frequency plots)
- Connect to sentiment classifiers
- Package into a small Flask web app

## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me
